## Hi there. I am Sarah, aka Solaara.

- 💼 I'm a **systems administrator** (mainly Debian and RHEL-based, Cisco networking and ESXi/AWS) and **full-stack web-dev** (mainly React/NextJS with a Java or Rust backend) by trade.

- 🏠 In my free time I tinker on time-waster **programming** projects, make **shitty music** or play **Final Fantasy XIV**.

- 🌐 I have a **website** available at [**https://www.solaara.net/**](https://www.solaara.net/) which I redo for fun every once in a while (planning to make it my **portfolio** in the future, when I have time...)

- 🖇️ I am currently working towards building skills regarding **Kubernetes and overall container orchestration**, especially on bare-metal through [**Talos**](https://talos.dev/).

- 🌃 My dream project is making an **MMORPG** and learning both **game making** and **online game development** through it.
